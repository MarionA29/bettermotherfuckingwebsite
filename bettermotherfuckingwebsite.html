  <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
  <p>Really, it is.</p>
</header>

<h2>
  Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?
</h2>

<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

<p>
  <span class="wr">WRONG</span>, motherfucker</p>

<h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

<p>This website is even better than the last
  <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy </a> before him.
</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript
    <img src="js.png" alt="logo JS" title="JS logo" height=".5em">,
    CSS3 and HTML5.
  <li>It uses the
    <a href="http://wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
    <p class="monospace">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Put even less contrast</h2>

<p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.

</p>
<p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a motherfuckingwebsite.
</p>

<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>

<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

<h2>Put some pictures</h2>

<div class="cat">

<div class="picturecat">
  <img src="cat.jpg" alt="cute cat">
  <p class="caption">A cat, just to keep the context of the website.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="textcat">
<p>  We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a context.<br>
</p>
<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.<br>
</p>
<p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.
</p>
</div>


</div>

<h2>Yes, even this is satire</h2>

<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your
  <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
 with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>

<blockquote>
  <span>Good design is as little design as possible.</span>
  <author>
    Some German motherfucker
  </author>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not entirely true, look at that motherfuckingwebsite. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.
</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the motherfuckingwebsite and the bettermotherfuckingwebsite.
</p>

<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.
</p>

<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"

<h2>Author</h2>

<p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can be followed on Twitter, followed on GitHub or contacted here, on his ultra-minimalist website
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The cat picture was taken from the cool Pixabay website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka Public Domain) content. The author is 1899441 (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the old picture was by aloiswohlfahrt, but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute. You can open an issue on GitHub if you think that this decision goes against the rules of a good looking motherfuckingwebsite.</p>

<h2>Legal</h2>

Don't worry, it can be read in less than 30 seconds, unless you have some sort of reading disability - in that case, I'm wondering why you're still reading this text. Really. Stop. Please. I mean, seriously. Why are you still reading?</p>
